# Option-Price-Predictor
The Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model and the Black-Scholes model are both used to predict option prices.  The CRR model is a binomial options pricing model that assumes the underlying asset price can only move up or down over a given time period. It calculates option prices by constructing a binomial tree and evaluating the expected value of the option at expiration.  The Black-Scholes model, on the other hand, is a continuous-time mathematical model that assumes the underlying asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion. It calculates option prices by considering factors such as the current stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility.  Both models have their own assumptions and limitations, and their accuracy may vary depending on market conditions. It's important to note that option pricing is a complex task and requires careful consideration of various factors.
